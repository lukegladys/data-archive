    // static bootstrapping methods) and injecting configuration properties as strings/etc directly into your services to keep
    // them unit testable.

    // IMPORTANT: the ConfigurationBuilder class merges env variable & appsettings config into one object, so make sure none of the keys
    // in your appsettings.json object are named the same as one of your environment variables, since one will overwrite the other.
